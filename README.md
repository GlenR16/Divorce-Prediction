## Summary
This application allows the user to predict if they are going to face a divorce on the basis of the answers to several questions. 
Please not that this verdict may not be accurate as something as complex as a relationship cannot be predicted by mere AI.
Our model boasts a cross validation accuracy of 97%. The backend uses Django as the main web framework and the frontend uses Bootstrap as the main CSS extension.
